<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p><h2>Mountains</h2>have been an incredibly generous mentor in last few years helping me transform from an unhealthy 90 kilo software engineer into a mountaineer who built a top of the world body and mind and climbed to the top of Everest! And it makes utmost sense to pay it forward by sharing the learnings with and mentoring other aspiring mountaineers on their journeys to the top!
  .
  With this in mind, thirteen of us - mountain and outdoor lovers spent 3 days together in the Aira canyon in Sahyadri mountains as part of a program I call - Everest boot camp! Under the able leadership of one of the elite Sherpa guide , the idea was to get a holistic view of mountaineering - not only just learn and build a specific skill-set, but also work on intangible - getting comfortable in the most uncomfortable situations - which <br> <h3>IMO is the key to success in mountains and life!</h3>
